Aspect,Paired Region (Recommended),Non-Paired Region (Possible, but Limited),What Breaks/Doesn't Work
Replication & Redundancy,Automatic geo-replication (e.g., GRS/RA-GRS in Storage with RPO <15 min). ASR natively supports paired failover mappings.,Manual setup required (e.g., custom ASR plans, cross-region VNet peering). Replication is asynchronous but not optimized.,- No automatic failover orchestration.
- Services like Storage GRS/RA-GRS only work within pairs—use ZRS or custom replication for non-paired.
- Higher data loss risk during failover due to unoptimized sync.
Latency & Performance,Low latency (e.g., East US to West US: ~50-80 ms round-trip). Intra-geography pairing minimizes delays.,Higher latency (e.g., East US to Japan East: 200+ ms). Cross-geo traffic increases sync times.,- Slower RPO/RTO (e.g., minutes to hours vs. seconds).
- Degraded performance for latency-sensitive apps (e.g., real-time databases).
Costs,Lower egress fees for intra-pair replication (often waived).,Higher data transfer costs ($0.08–$0.12/GB egress for cross-geo).,- Increased bandwidth bills for replication traffic.
- No free intra-region data movement benefits.
Compliance & Data Residency,Same geography (e.g., both US), simplifying GDPR/HIPAA/FedRAMP compliance.,Cross-geography may violate residency rules (e.g., US to EU data).,- Potential legal/compliance issues if data crosses borders without approval.
- Manual auditing required for sovereignty.
Failover & Recovery,Prioritized recovery (Microsoft restores at least one region in a pair first). Native ASR failover plans.,Manual failover (e.g., trigger ASR, update DNS, reprovision). No priority during outages.,- ASR doesn't auto-map non-paired; custom plans needed.
- Longer downtime if both regions affected (no isolation guarantee).
- Services like Cosmos DB or SQL geo-replication may not support non-paired natively.
Service Support,Full support for geo-redundant features (e.g., Key Vault failover, VM replication).,Partial support; some services (e.g., Storage GRS) unavailable.,- Limited for services like Azure NetApp Files or certain VM SKUs (e.g., M-series) in non-paired setups.
- No built-in multi-region BCDR for Virtual Desktop or SAP workloads without custom config.
Management & Testing,Simplified via portal/CLI (e.g., `az backup vault create --target-region <paired>`).,Requires custom VNet peering, VPNs, or ExpressRoute for connectivity.,- More complex testing (manual failover drills).
- No pre-built templates for non-paired DR.
